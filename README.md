# Liu Rui from jour2106

Hi everyone. I'm Ray, 22 (but look younger). I took a data visualisation *theory* course before. But still I think *practice* is more important. Data journalism is quite a new area. Hope I will learn more from you all~

## Key words
* Third-year
* Major in journalism 
* Know a little bit about coding; Simple illustration with CorelDraw
* A very good listener 

## Topic I'm interested in
Any topic is ok. But I still prefer the billing of private doctor. 

## Teamate I'm looking for
